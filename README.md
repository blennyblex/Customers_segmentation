# Cohort Analysis of Repeated Buyers & Retention Patterns

This project conducts an in-depth **cohort analysis** of customer purchasing behaviour, aiming to identify retention patterns and revenue contributions from various buyer groups. The insights derived can guide personalised marketing, customer segmentation, and strategic business decisions.

---

## Objective

To analyse customer behaviour over time and categorise customers into cohorts based on their purchase frequency and behaviour, such as:

- One-time buyers
- Weekly buyers
- Bi-weekly buyers
- Monthly buyers
- Bi-monthly buyers
- Quarterly buyers
- Occasional buyers

## Key Analyses Performed

### 1. **Customer Segmentation**
Customers are grouped into cohorts based on their purchase frequency. Each group represents a behavioral pattern useful for marketing and retention strategies.

### 2. **Group Composition**
Calculate the **percentage distribution** of customers across all defined cohorts relative to the total customer base.

### 3. **Product Preferences by Group**
Analyse the most commonly purchased products within each cohort group to identify group-specific preferences.

### 4. **Average Order Value (AOV)**
Compute the **average order value per group** to understand the spending pattern of each cohort.

### 5. **Revenue Contribution**
Determine the **revenue contribution percentage** of each customer group across different time periods:
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Semi-annually (six months)
- Annually (yearly)

### 6. **Profit Margin Analysis**
Estimate the **average profit margin per basket** for each customer group to evaluate the profitability of retaining specific cohorts.

### 7. **Customer Details per Group**
Generate a detailed report of customers in each group, including:
- Customer ID
- Purchase frequency
- Total spend
- Products purchased
- Last purchase date

### 8. **Cohort Retention Analysis**
Perform **temporal cohort analysis** for key frequency groups (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) to evaluate:
- Retention over time
- Drop-off points
- Lifetime value trends

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, plotly.graph_objects)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel / CSV files for data input**

## Future Improvements

- Integrate customer demographic data to enrich cohort profiling.
- Apply machine learning for customer lifetime value (CLV) prediction.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard for real-time cohort tracking.
